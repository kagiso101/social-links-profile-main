## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was my second attempt at this project , I originally finished the first one using my own info and an Api that generates random advice just to spice things up a bit, But Im still figuring out a way to host angular applications on a free platform like github /netlify. These are projects I do to help my students gain a better understanding of how the frontend works so there's a limit to what I can learn using plain html and css, although I must say it was fun doing this project . (took me an hour to finish and then an additional 30min for this readme )

### Continued development

For furture projects , I'll be using angular 18 as soon as I learn how to deploy them
